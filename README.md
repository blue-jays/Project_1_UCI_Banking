# Projec_1_UCI_Banking
A public repository that houses my first ever in-depth data science project. This project will be updated periodically adding breadth and depth to the solution.


This project puts emphasis on 2 things: the vast amount and of data preprocessing that is needed to apply machine learning model and how sometimes EDA and simple graphs and charts provide more information that a ML model can ever provide. Most of the insghts and key findings were from EDA, so depending on the problem, either one of ML or EDA or both of them shines.
